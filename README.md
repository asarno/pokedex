Welcome to my Pokedex! Feel free to clone this repo and follow the below steps to be up and running :) 

## Getting Started

In the project directory, run:

## `yarn`

then

## `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Hints

One of the hints that may not be clear is that you can go back to the home page simply by clicking the `Pokedex` image at the top of the screen. Also feel free to take advantage of the search field.

## `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!


## TODO:

1. Abstracting the graphql queries into a single file (similar to how I made a `types` & `styledComponents`
2. Fixing up the loaders after selecting a Pokemon (show poke ball for each card as it fetches corresponding evolutions of a selected Pokemon)
3. Make search bar adjust depending on size of screen (mobile friendly)
4. Write tests
5. Set up CI process
